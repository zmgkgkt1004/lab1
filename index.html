  <p> Hello world. This is my first website!</p>1
  <p> My name is Joseph Kim and I am a first year at IIT.</p>
  <p> I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Management.</p>
  <p> I am taking this class because it is a requirement, but also so I can learn more on how to code with HTML and CSS.</p>
